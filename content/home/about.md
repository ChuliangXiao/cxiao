# Biography

  I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Michigan's [Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR)](http://ciglr.seas.umich.edu) working at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL)](http://glerl.noaa.gov) in Ann Arbor, Michigan. My fields of specialization include research on hydroclimatology and climate change in the Great Lakes region using numerical models ([WRF](https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/weather-research-and-forecasting-model) and [WRF-Hydro](https://ral.ucar.edu/projects/wrf_hydro/overview)).

  As a modeler in Atmospheric Sciences, I am dealing with "Big Meteorological Data" from in-situ observation stations, buoys, radars, satellites, and mostly numerical models. Specifically, I employ a sophisticated regional climate model (WRF-Lake)  to conduct long-term simulations and projections of the hydroclimatology in Great Lakes region: precipitation, temperature, ice coverage, river discharge, lake level, with analysis and visualization programming tools (e.g. *NCL*, *R* and *Python*).
