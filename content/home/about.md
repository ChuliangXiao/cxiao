# Biography

  I am a research fellow at the University of Michigan's [Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR)](http://ciglr.seas.umich.edu) working at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL)](http://glerl.noaa.gov) in Ann Arbor, Michigan. My fields of specialization include research on hydroclimatology and climate change in the Great Lakes region using numerical models ([WRF](https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/weather-research-and-forecasting-model) and [WRF-Hydro](https://ral.ucar.edu/projects/wrf_hydro/overview)).

- **Data Analysis**
Developing novel approaches to analyze a variety of datasets in climate science using tools like _R_ language, _Python_, _Linux/BASH_, NCAR Command Language (_NCL_) and Fortran.  
- **R Developer**
Focusing on data wrangling/visualization (`tidyverse`), predictive modeling (`rpart`, `randomForest`, `caret`, `xgboost`), big data (`data.table`, `sparklyr`, `ncdf4`), geospatial analysis (`sf`, `tmap`, `ggmap`), and interactive web applications (`mapview`, `shiny`, `plotly`)  
- **Numerical Modeling**
Implementing state-of-the-art climatic and hydrological models to improve the understanding of air-lake interaction, regional climate responses to global warming, flooding and lake level.
