<p>I used to blog a little bit on <a href="http://gzhy.blogspot.com/">Blogger</a> when I was in China. I have stopped blogging for a long time since the emergency of social networks. Looking back at what I wrote when I was a young college student, I couldnâ€™t help but feel how different I am right now. I really hope I can start likeing writting things again, focusing on <strong>R &amp; Data Science</strong> from a geoscience perspective.</p>
