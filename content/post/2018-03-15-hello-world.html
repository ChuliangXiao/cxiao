<p>I used to blog a little bit on <a href="http://gzhy.blogspot.com/">Blogger</a> when I was in China. I have stopped blogging for a long time since the emergency of social networks. Looking back at what I wrote when I was a young college student, I couldnâ€™t help but feel how different I am right now.</p>
<p>As a meteorological researcher working with numerical models and datasets, I am more of a data scientist. Programming wise, I have being on the traditional track: starting with the basis of C and Fortran, then the script visualization tool in Atmospheric Science <a href="http://cola.gmu.edu/grads/">GrADS</a> for a while before transitioning to <a href="https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/">NCL</a>. Now I am shifting my effort from atmospheric science-specialized NCL to a more generic R language.</p>
<p>Huge thanks for <a href="https://yihui.name/en/about/">Yihui Xie</a> and his <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown">blogdown</a>.</p>
