I used to blog a little bit on [Blogger](http://gzhy.blogspot.com/) when I was in China. I have stopped blogging for a long time since the emergency of social networks. Looking back at what I wrote when I was a young college student, I couldn't help but feel how different I am right now.

As a meteorological researcher working with numerical models and datasets, I am more of a data scientist. Programming wise, I have being on the traditional track: starting with the basis of C and Fortran, then the script visualization tool in Atmospheric Science [GrADS](http://cola.gmu.edu/grads/) for a while before transitioning to [NCL](https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/). Now I am shifting my effort from atmospheric science-specialized NCL to a more generic R language.
