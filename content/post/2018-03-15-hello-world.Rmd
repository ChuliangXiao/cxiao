I used to blog a little bit on [Blogger](http://gzhy.blogspot.com/) when I was in China. I have stopped blogging for a long time since the emergency of social networks. Looking back at what I wrote when I was a young college student, I couldn't help but feel how different I am right now. I really hope I can start likeing writting things again, focusing on **R & Data Science** from a geoscience perspective.  

Huge thanks for [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/en/about/) and his [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown).
