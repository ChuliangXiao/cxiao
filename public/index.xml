      <description>&lt;p&gt;I used to blog a little bit on &lt;a href=&#34;http://gzhy.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt; when I was in China. I have stopped blogging for a long time since the emergency of social networks. Looking back at what I wrote when I was a young college student, I couldn’t help but feel how different I am right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a meteorological researcher working with numerical models and datasets, I am more of a data scientist. Programming wise, I have being on the traditional track: starting with the basis of C and Fortran, then the script visualization tool in Atmospheric Science &lt;a href=&#34;http://cola.gmu.edu/grads/&#34;&gt;GrADS&lt;/a&gt; for a while before transitioning to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/&#34;&gt;NCL&lt;/a&gt;. Now I am shifting my effort from atmospheric science-specialized NCL to a more generic R language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge thanks for &lt;a href=&#34;https://yihui.name/en/about/&#34;&gt;Yihui Xie&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown&#34;&gt;blogdown&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At 6 PM, Dr. Xiao will present on Big Data and Climate Modeling. Dr. Xiao works at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL) in Ann Arbor. He specializes in hydro-climatology and climate change in the Great Lakes region using regional numerical climate models. As a climate modeler, Dr. Xiao deals with &amp;ldquo;Big Meteorological Data&amp;rdquo; from in-situ observation stations, buoys, radars, satellites, and mostly numerical models. He uses a sophisticated regional climate model (written in Fortran) to conduct century-scale simulations and projections (terabyte scale) of the hydroclimatology in Great Lakes region in terms of precipitation, temperature, ice coverage, river discharge, lake level, etc, with post-processing done by using analysis and visualization programming tools (e.g. NCL, R and Python). Dr. Xiao&amp;rsquo;s presentation should be an interesting source of ideas for data scientists and data analysts in other fields because climate modelers have developed and employ special methods of working with big data.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Implementing the WRF-Hydro Modeling System in the Great Lakes Region</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a physics-based, spatially-distributed hydrologic modeling system, the community Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) hydrological extension package (WRF-Hydro) has been used in several streamflow prediction applications in the U.S. and around the world, including the National Water Model (NWM) at the newly established NOAA National Water Center. However, because of lack of consistency of the geofabric data along the U.S. and Canada borders, the Great Lakes basin is not entirely included in NWM, leaving a substantial gap for applying the national model to the water-dominated region. Thus, a specific effort has been devoted to implementing the WRF-Hydro modeling system in the Great Lakes basin, including preparing high-resolution terrain datasets, parameterizing lakes and reservoirs, and calibrating the model. Two experiments have been carried out to support implementation of the NWM in the Great Lakes basin: an offline WRF-Hydro simulation forced by NLDAS2 and a coupled WRF/WRF-Hydro simulation. The model results are validated against observations in terms of precipitation, runoff, soil moisture, channel flow, and land surface heat fluxes. Our preliminary study presented here shows that the WRF-Hydro model is capable of reproducing the land–hydro-air feedbacks in the Great Lakes region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The implementation of the community Weather Research and Forecasting model hydrological extension package (WRF-Hydro) (&lt;a href=&#34;https://ral.ucar.edu/projects/wrf_hydro/overview&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Gochis et al. 2013&lt;/a&gt;) in the Great Lakes region with collaborators from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) supported by a newly granted NOAA Joint Technology Transfer Initiative (JTTI) project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beginning in the summer of 2016, the NOAA &lt;a href=&#34;http://water.noaa.gov&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;National Water Center (NWC)&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and other academic partners will produce operational hydrologic predictions for the nation using a new National Water Model (NWM) that is based on WRF-Hydro. The WRF-Hydro modeling system is a physics-based, distributed hydrologic modeling system and has been used in several streamflow prediction applications in the U.S. and around the world.  The modeling system provides users with a multi-physics and multi-scale modeling framework for representing a large range of terrestrial hydrologic processes such as infiltration, runoff, lateral flow, channel flow, soil moisture, snowpack, and evapotranspiration as well as various water management components.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because of lack of consistency of high-resolution terrain (also known as “geofabric”) data along the U.S. and Canada borders, the Great Lakes basin is not entirely included in the current version of NWM, leaving a substantial gap for applying the national model to the water-dominated region with the largest lake system on earth. Thus, a specific effort has been devoted to implementing the WRF-Hydro modeling system in the Great Lakes basin, including preparing high-resolution terrain datasets, parameterizing lakes and reservoirs, and calibrating the model.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The lake module in WRF (original called LISSS, Subin et al. 2012) was obtained from the Community Land Model version 4.5 with some modifications by Gu et al. (2015), based on the origional concept of Hostetler and Bartlein (1990), which performs quite well in shallow lakes (depth &amp;lt; 50 m). (Incorporated in WRF since v3.6). Our work (Xiao et al. 2016) further updated the lake module in WRF with the surface albedo scheme and vertical diffusivity to improve the lake surface temperature and lake ice simulation in the Great Lakes.&lt;/p&gt;
