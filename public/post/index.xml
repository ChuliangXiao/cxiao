      <title>From NCL to R</title>

      <description>From the point of atmospheric science, NCL has certain natural advantages in dealing with self-described meteorological data formats, but R is improving significantly.
Unformated BinaryI have to say both NCL and R are not as good at reading/writing binary files as Fotran, though technically they are able to do the job.Self-decribed BinaryNCL uses a single function addfile to handle all format (netCDF, HDF, GRIB, CCM, shapefile), while R requires additional packages.</description>

      <description>I used to blog a little bit on Blogger when I was in China. I have stopped blogging for a long time since the emergency of social networks. Looking back at what I wrote when I was a young college student, I couldnâ€™t help but feel how different I am right now. I really hope I can start likeing writting things again, focusing on R &amp;amp; Data Science from a geoscience perspective.</description>
