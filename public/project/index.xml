      <description>The implementation of the community Weather Research and Forecasting model hydrological extension package (WRF-Hydro) (Gochis et al. 2013) in the Great Lakes region with collaborators from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) supported by a newly granted NOAA Joint Technology Transfer Initiative (JTTI) project.
 Beginning in the summer of 2016, the NOAA National Water Center (NWC) in partnership with the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and other academic partners will produce operational hydrologic predictions for the nation using a new National Water Model (NWM) that is based on WRF-Hydro.</description>

      <description>The lake module in WRF (original called LISSS, Subin et al. 2012) was obtained from the Community Land Model version 4.5 with some modifications by Gu et al. (2015), based on the origional concept of Hostetler and Bartlein (1990), which performs quite well in shallow lakes (depth &amp;lt; 50 m). (Incorporated in WRF since v3.6). Our work (Xiao et al. 2016) further updated the lake module in WRF with the surface albedo scheme and vertical diffusivity to improve the lake surface temperature and lake ice simulation in the Great Lakes.</description>
